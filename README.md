## üß™ 4. Testing

### 4.1. Requirements

* Install [Docker][docker]
* Install [Docker Compose v2.5.0+][docker-compose]

<sup>[Back to top ^][table-of-contents]</sup>

### 4.2. Running Tests

The test script begins by building and starting a local Near network using the credentials in [`.near`](./.near). Once this has started, the tests are run against this local validator node.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** As the local network contains one validator node, all blocks are handled by this validator.

Within this local network, account IDs will fave the suffix of `.test.near`, i.e. `myaccount.test.near`.

The main account (`.test.near`), whose credentials are stored at [`./test/credentials`](./test/credentials), can be used as a faucet or to deploy contracts.
