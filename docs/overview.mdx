## Introduction

An airdrop tool for NEP-141 tokens that is designed to shoot a number of tokens to an NFT allowlist (or any list), with the ability to shoot multiple allocations to specific addresses. Supports both uniform distribution with multipliers and specific amounts for each recipient.

The tool provides a command-line interface for distributing NEP-141 tokens to multiple accounts, with features including:

- **Multiple Distribution Modes**: Supports both multiplier-based and manual distribution
- **Dry Run Simulation**: Test your airdrop without actually transferring tokens
- **Flexible JSON Format**: Simple configuration for recipient lists
- **Automatic Conversion**: Handles conversion between standard and atomic units

For installation instructions, see the [Getting Started](usage/getting-started) guide.
