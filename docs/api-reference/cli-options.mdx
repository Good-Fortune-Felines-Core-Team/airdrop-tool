# CLI Options

The `airdrop-tool` command line has a number of useful options. You can run `airdrop-tool --help` to view all available options. Many of the options shown below can also be used together to the airdrop exactly the way you want.

## Reference

### Required

#### `--accountId=<account>`

The signer account ID that will be used to authorized to airdrop the tokens.

#### `--accounts=<path>`

The path to the JSON file that contains a list of accounts and number of NFTs the account holds. The number will be used to multiply the tokens.

Each entry in the JSON file must conform to the below structure:

```json
{
    "account1.near": "3",
    "account2.near": "1"
}
```

:::caution

The file **MUST** be a JSON file and the file **MUST** be in the same format as the above example. An error will be thrown otherwise.

:::

#### `--amount=<number>`

The amount of tokens (in standard units) to airdrop. This is used as the base amount in multiplier mode.

:::note
This option should NOT be used with `--manual`.
:::

### Optional

#### `--manual`

Enables manual mode where JSON values are treated as standard (human-readable) token amounts rather than multipliers.

In manual mode:
- The JSON file contains account IDs as keys and specific token amounts in standard units as values
- The tool automatically converts standard amounts to atomic units based on the token's decimals
- `--amount` should NOT be used with this option

See [Distribution Modes](../usage/distribution-modes#manual-mode) for more details.

#### `--dry-run`

Simulates the airdrop without actually transferring tokens. This is useful for verifying your distribution configuration before executing.

Works with both multiplier and manual modes, and outputs detailed information about what would happen during an actual airdrop.

See [Dry Run Mode](../usage/distribution-modes#dry-run-mode) for more details.

#### `--credentials=<path>`

The path to the directory that contains the credentials for the account specified in "accountId".

Default: `~/.near-credentials`

#### `--network=<network>`

The target network.

Default: `mainnet`

#### `--output=<path>`

The directory to output the completed transfers. This directory will be used for both the completed transfers and any failed transfers.

Completed transfers will be in a file named `{timestamp}-{accounts-file-name}-completed.json`, and any failed transfers will be in a file named `{YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS}-{accounts-file-name}-failed.json`.

Default: `~/.jumpdefi`

#### `--verbose`

Logs extra information.
