# Distribution Modes

The airdrop tool supports multiple distribution modes to give you flexibility in how tokens are allocated to recipients.

## Multiplier Mode (Default)

In this mode, you specify a base amount and each recipient receives a multiple of that amount.

```bash
$ airdrop-tool --accountId <sender-account> --token <token-contract-address> --accounts <path-to-json-file> --amount <base-amount>
```

- `--amount`: The base amount of tokens (in standard units) to airdrop
- The JSON file contains account IDs as keys and multipliers as values

### Example

If you set `--amount=10` and your JSON file contains:

```json
{
  "account1.near": "1",
  "account2.near": "0.5",
  "account3.near": "2"
}
```

The distribution would be:
- `account1.near` would receive 1 × 10 = 10 tokens
- `account2.near` would receive 0.5 × 10 = 5 tokens
- `account3.near` would receive 2 × 10 = 20 tokens

## Manual Mode

In this mode, you specify the exact amount for each recipient directly in the JSON file.

```bash
$ airdrop-tool --accountId <sender-account> --token <token-contract-address> --accounts <path-to-json-file> --manual
```

- `--manual`: Enables manual mode where JSON values are standard (human-readable) token amounts
- The JSON file contains account IDs as keys and specific token amounts in standard units as values
- The tool automatically converts standard amounts to atomic units based on the token's decimals
- `--amount` should NOT be used with `--manual`

### Example

With the `--manual` flag and a JSON file containing:

```json
{
  "account1.near": "1",
  "account2.near": "0.5",
  "account3.near": "2"
}
```

The distribution would be:
- `account1.near` would receive exactly 1 token in standard units
- `account2.near` would receive exactly 0.5 tokens in standard units
- `account3.near` would receive exactly 2 tokens in standard units

The tool automatically converts these standard amounts to the appropriate atomic units based on the token's decimals.

## Dry Run Mode

The tool provides a dry run mode that simulates the airdrop without actually transferring tokens:

```bash
$ airdrop-tool --accountId <sender-account> --token <token-contract-address> --accounts <path-to-json-file> --dry-run [--amount <base-amount> | --manual]
```

- `--dry-run`: Simulates the airdrop without executing transfers
- Works with both multiplier and manual modes
- Outputs detailed information about what would happen during an actual airdrop

This mode is useful for:
- Verifying your distribution configuration before executing
- Checking token balances to ensure sufficient funds
- Estimating gas costs for the operation

## JSON File Format

The JSON file format is the same for both distribution modes, but the interpretation of the values differs:

```json
{
  "account1.near": "1",
  "account2.near": "0.5",
  "account3.near": "2"
}
```

- In **Multiplier Mode**: Values are treated as multipliers of the base amount
- In **Manual Mode**: Values are treated as exact token amounts in standard units

:::caution

The file **MUST** be a valid JSON file. An error will be thrown otherwise.
